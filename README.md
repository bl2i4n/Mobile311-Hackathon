##About this app

This app is inspired by the need to increase efficiencies in local governments in providing resident services. In an age where most people have cell phones, there is no need for someone to take a phone call to report trash problems, graffiti, broken street lights, and the like. In the traditional call center model, a written report is taken and then is qued for a city employee to visually inspect before anything happens. What if residents can report visual evidence, bypassing the need for an employee to visit? Cell phones and images will send data with date, time, and location along with the image.

Existing solutions are desktop-based, and do not provide a good user experience. Images must be uploaded from the local computer.

Mobile 311 effectively crowd-sources the livability of the city and gives visual context to work orders requiring government attention to improve the livability of the city in a cost-effective manner. Residents also benefit by being able to report issues in real-time, using the technology they already have in their hands.

This technology can be extended to other industries, such as local power companies. For example, overgrown trees that are a risk to power lines can be reported with minimal effort and prioritized for remediation.
